# Summary

Watch here: https://youtu.be/kS-vLoGrEr4 

It's time for Wall-E! Again... This time it's not a huge multi-part robot that doesn't work. It's a small figure that is now a single piece and doesn't have spots for electronics inside.

Since I already had all the individual pieces modeled, I just had to assemble them and fill any gaps or holes. After that I went through and added extras here and there to make it print easy or stronger in specific areas.

After that my wife painted it using filler primer, followed by an airbrush for the yellow area, then paintbrush using acrylic paints for the remaining colors. And to wrap it up she sprayed it with an clear coat.
